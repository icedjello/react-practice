      class -> object 
      A class is used to create objects which is what is used by the program to do stuff.
      
      You can define what an object has via their Instance Properties eg: 
      - name 
      - age 
      - height

      These are unique to each object created from that class.

      You can also define what an object does via their Instance Methods eg: 
      - talk
      - run
      - jump
